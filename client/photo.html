  <h1>Blip notes</h1>
  
  <p>This demo works best in Chrome. <a href="https://github.com/meteor/mobile-packages/issues/45">Safari on iOS doesn't support the camera API</a>, unfortunately. The oldest photo was taken in the desktop version of Chrome. The second oldest was taken on Chrome on Android.</p>
  <p>The same codebase can produce an iOS app though, which has full camera support.</p>
  <p>Code and README are <a href="https://github.com/dandv/meteor-photo-notes">on GitHub</a>.</p>
  <p>There are more features than meet the eye. Check out the README!</p>
